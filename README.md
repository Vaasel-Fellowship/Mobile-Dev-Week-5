## Week 5: Database Integration:
1. Explore different database options in Flutter, such as SQLite, Firebase Realtime Database, or Firestore. (Firebase is recommended)
2. Learn how to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using a database in Flutter.
3. Developing a chat app with real-time messaging using Firebase

### Porject
#### Task Manager
##### Description:
1. Create a task management app that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. The app will store the tasks in a database, providing a seamless user experience.

##### Features:
1. Task Creation: Provide a form for users to input task details such as title, description, due date, and priority. When a user creates a new task, store it in the database.
2. Task List: Display a list of tasks with their corresponding details (title, description, due date, and priority). Retrieve and display tasks from the database.
3. Task Details: Allow users to view and edit individual task details. Implement functionality to update task details and reflect the changes in the database.
4. Task Deletion: Enable users to delete tasks from the app. Remove the corresponding task from the database when a user deletes it.
5. Task Filtering and Sorting: Implement options to filter and sort tasks based on criteria such as priority or due date. Update the task list dynamically based on the selected filters and sorting options.
6. Real-time Updates: If using a real-time database like Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore, implement real-time updates so that any changes made by other users are instantly reflected in the app.
7. Data Persistence: Ensure that task data is persisted locally using a local database like SQLite, allowing users to access their tasks even when offline.
8. User Experience: Pay attention to the user interface and user experience to create an intuitive and visually appealing app. Implement features like error handling, loading indicators, and notifications to enhance the user experience.
